gradle-verify-instrumentation-plugin
====================================

This plugin provides support for `verifyInstrumentation` DSL in New Relic instrumentation gradle build files. Using this plugin, you can figure out what range of versions for a library are supported by your instrumentation.  

:warning: This plugin has a very niche use case for the New Relic Java Agent. 
It is not intended to be used or modified for any other environment.

Open source license
====================================

This project is distributed under the Apache 2 license.

What do you need to make this work?
====================================

Required: 
* Gradle, minimum 5.6
* Java 11

Java Runtime
====================================

Most Java agent instrumentation modules are compiled to target Java 8+ however some are compiled to target Java 11+. The verifier must be run with a minimum Java runtime of 11 or it will fail when trying to verify instrumentation targeting Java 11+.

Start using the plugin
====================================

To use the plugin, update your buildscript dependencies in settings.gradle:

```gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
      mavenLocal()
      mavenCentral()
      gradlePluginPortal()
    }
  }
```

Update your build.gradle:

```gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.newrelic.agent.java:gradle-verify-instrumentation-plugin:3.1"
    }
}

apply plugin "com.newrelic.gradle-verify-instrumentation-plugin"
```

Or:

```gradle
 plugins {
   id("com.newrelic.gradle-verify-instrumentation-plugin") version "3.1"
 }
```

**Note** For instrumentation bundled with the New Relic Java agent, this is already configured and these steps are not required.

## Configuring the plugin

To configure the plugin for a specific weave instrumentation library, in each instrumentation's `build.gradle`, you'll need to configure a `verifyInstrumentation` block. Within this block, specify maven ranges that your module should pass or fail against.

The task downloads all versions (and all required dependencies) within the testing ranges. Each version downloaded is then checked to make sure the instrumentation in this module applies as expected:

* If the target code is covered by `passes` or `passesOnly`, then the module must apply successfully.
* If the target code is covered by fails or is outside of a `passesOnly` range, then the module must not apply successfully.
* If the condition above is not met, the gradle task fails with the reason.

```gradle
verifyInstrumentation {
    fails("com.typesafe.play:anorm_2.11:[1.0,2.0)")
    passes("com.typesafe.play:anorm_2.11:[2.0,2.5)")
    fails("com.typesafe.play:anorm_2.11:[2.5,)")
}
```

In this example, we are saying that versions 2.0 (inclusive) through versions 2.5 (exclusive) of the "anorm_2.11" library should instrument correctly. We are also saying that versions 1.0 (inclusive) through versions 2.0 (exclusive) should fail. We also assert that versions greater than or equal to 2.5 fail instrumentation. This ensures that our instrumentation only works with the range specified in passes.

There are several options to use to configure the range support. In no particular order:
* `passes` specifies the range that _should_ be able to be instrumented. It does not perform any checks on versions outside the range.
* `fails` specifies the range that _should_ fail to be instrumented.
* `passesOnly` specifies the range that _should_ be able to be instrumented. It then checks all versions outside the range (for the same group:name) to ensure those versions fail.
* `exclude` specifies versions (can be a range) to exclude
* `excludeRegex` specifies versions to exclude using a regex, useful for excluding all snapshot builds, for example.
* `[]` configures an inclusive match
* `()` configures an exclusive match

For more information on range syntax, see [Maven version syntax](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVENOLD/Dependency+Mediation+and+Conflict+Resolution#DependencyMediationandConflictResolution-DependencyVersionRanges).

**Note** In general, using `passesOnly` is preferable, as it ensures that only the given range works against your instrumentation, and not anything else. We can rewrite our above example with one line using `passesOnly`:

```gradle
verifyInstrumentation {
    passesOnly  'com.typesafe.play:anorm_2.11:[2.0,2.5)'
}
```

### Configuring the plugin outside the `java_agent` repo

The `java_agent` repo configuration includes several values you must set if using `verifyInstrumentation` outside the `java_agent` repo.

* `nrAgent` must be a reference to the newrelic.jar fat jar. You can specify a `String` to use a maven dependency, or a `File` to reference a local file.
* `passesFileName` is a file name as a `String` if you want all successful verifications to log to the same file. That is, when the package fails to apply when it should fail, or applies successfully when it should apply successfully. 
* `verifyClasspath` can be used to verify that the jar successfully applies when loading exactly the `compile` and `implementation` dependencies specified for the implementation jar. 

## Running the plugin

To verify all instrumentation libraries, simply invoke:
```gradle
.../java_agent/$ ./gradlew verifyInstrumentation
```
...and then go for a fresh cup of coffee. You have enough time to get get a really good cup a couple blocks away.

To verify a specific instrumentation module, invoke:

```gradle
...cd instrumentation/moduleToVerify
.../moduleToVerify/$ ../../gradlew verifyInstrumentation
```
Or:

```gradle
.../java_agent/$ ./gradlew :instrumentation:moduleToVerify:verifyInstrumentation
```

## Additional Dependencies

By default, the Maven library is verified with its transitive dependencies. To specify additional dependencies while verifying, add a configuration closure and use 'compile'.

```gradle
verifyInstrumentation {
  passesOnly("io.spray:spray-routing_2.11:[1.3.1,)") {
    compile("com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.11:2.3.14") // akka is not explicitly listed as a spray dependency so we have to tell the verifier to include it.
  }
}
```

## Choosing versions

The versions to include and exclude are entirely dependent upon the target library being instrumented. 

Once you have the general range of supported versions (something like `[2.0,2.5)`), you need to verify the whole range and make note of any failures. If you are maintaining an instrumentation module with an open-ended list (such as `[2.0,)`), then you need to run `verifyInstrumentation` periodically to ensure the version range is still correct.

You'll probably see that just one build here or there fails. With that, you should add an exception, as it's probably just a problem with a specific build of the target library. If you see a whole string of failures, it might indicate a more fundamental change in the library as of a specific version. In that case, you might need to cap the version support, and create a new instrumentation to handle the newer versions.
